# NetPy '21: Introduction to Network Science in Python

###### Workshop instructor

[Lovro Šubelj](http://lovro.fri.uni-lj.si), University of Ljubljana

###### Workshop schedule

Tuesday, 14th December 2021 at 4:00 PM (4 hours with breaks)

###### Workshop location

Lecture room 3 at [UL FRI](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si), Večna pot 113, Ljubljana, Slovenia

###### High-level description

This workshop is primarily aimed at Python programmers, either academics, professionals or students, that wish to learn the basics of modern network science and practical analyses of real networks, such as social, information and biological networks. Familiarity with the basics of probability theory and statistics, linear algebra, and machine learning is strongly encouraged.

The workshop is based on masters level course [Network Analysis](https://lovro.fri.uni-lj.si/posters/frinets.pdf) offered at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science.

###### Recommended prerequisites

It is recommended that attendees bring a laptop with working installation of [Python](http://www.python.org), [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io), [CDlib](http://cdlib.readthedocs.io) and [node2vec](https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/) packages. Alternatively, you can work with any other network analysis package such as [igraph](http://igraph.org), [graph-tool](http://graph-tool.skewed.de) or [SNAP.py](http://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/). For visualization of smaller networks, it is recommended to install some network analysis software such as [Gephi](http://gephi.org) or [visone](http://visone.info).
